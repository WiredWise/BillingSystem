## NetFlow Billing Landing Page (`landing-page.html`) & Admin Dashboard (`hotspot-dashboard-pages.html`)

This repository contains the front-end (HTML/CSS/JS) for the NetFlow Billing hotspot management system, comprising a public-facing **landing page** and an **admin dashboard**.

### Project Goal: Lightweight Yet Prestige Billing System (MVP - Work in Progress)

Our core objective for NetFlow Billing is to create a **lightweight yet prestige billing system** that offers robust functionality without unnecessary bloat. This project is currently an **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**, focusing on delivering essential features efficiently and elegantly, setting the foundation for future enhancements.

### Technical Stack

This project is being developed using the following technologies:

* **PHP**: For server-side logic and backend processing.
* **Tailwind CSS**: For a utility-first approach to styling, ensuring a highly responsive and modern user interface.
* **JavaScript**: For interactive front-end elements and dynamic content.
* **MySQL**: As the relational database management system for data storage.

### Admin Dashboard Overview (`hotspot-dashboard-pages.html`)

The `hotspot-dashboard-pages.html` file represents the administrative interface for managing the NetFlow Billing system. The current MVP provides a clean, responsive, and functional overview.

**Current State (MVP)**

The admin dashboard currently features:

* **Responsive Layout**: A sidebar navigation and a main content area, designed to adapt for both desktop and mobile views with a toggleable menu.
* **Top Bar**: Includes a dynamic page title, notification icon, and user profile display.
* **Dashboard Section**: Displays key performance indicators (KPIs) through informative cards (Active Hotspots, Active Users, Data Usage, Revenue) and visualizes data with Chart.js (Active Users, Data Usage charts). It also includes a table of active hotspots with status indicators.
* **Dedicated Sections**: Placeholder sections for `Hotspots`, `Users`, `Vouchers`, `Bandwidth`, `Reports`, and `Settings`, indicating the planned modularity.
* **Basic CRUD Modals**: Example modals for "Add Hotspot," "Add User," and "Generate Voucher" to demonstrate the intended data entry and management workflows.
* **Dropdown Actions**: Basic dropdown menus for table rows, allowing for actions like "Edit," "Delete," "Suspend," or "Activate."

**Objective of the Final Product (Admin Dashboard)**

The ultimate goal for the NetFlow Billing admin dashboard is to be the **central command center** for hotspot operators, embodying the "lightweight yet prestige" philosophy. It will be:

1.  **Intuitive & Powerful**: Provide a streamlined, user-friendly experience for administrators, regardless of technical proficiency, while offering deep control and insights into their Wi-Fi networks.
2.  **Real-time Insights**: Deliver live data and analytics on network performance, user activity, and revenue generation through dynamic charts and customizable reports.
3.  **Comprehensive Management**: Enable complete control over all aspects of hotspot operation, including:
    * **Hotspot Devices**: Centralized management, monitoring, and configuration of connected routers (MikroTik, Ubiquiti, etc.).
    * **User Lifecycle**: Seamless user creation, plan assignment, suspension, and detailed usage tracking.
    * **Flexible Billing**: Advanced tools for defining diverse billing models, generating and managing vouchers, and automating subscription cycles.
    * **Bandwidth Control**: Granular control over bandwidth allocation and traffic shaping per user or plan.
    * **Customizable Reporting**: Generation of in-depth, exportable reports for business analysis and auditing.
    * **System Configuration**: Robust settings for integrations, user roles, security protocols, and branding.
4.  **Secure & Reliable**: Built with robust security measures to protect sensitive user and financial data, ensuring uninterrupted service.
5.  **Scalable**: Designed to handle growing networks and increasing user bases efficiently without compromising performance.

This MVP serves as a functional preview, demonstrating the core structure and interaction patterns that will be expanded and refined to achieve the full vision of a prestige, lightweight, and powerful hotspot management platform.
